# Calculating sig figs
3 methods that handles calculating significant figures for addition/subtraction and multiplication/division.

## Getting Started
• [Download PHP 8.2.6](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)

• Open the project folders in your IDE, I used [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## WhAT DOES THE CODE DO
For both calculating addition/subtraction and multiplication/division functions, there are unknown amount of parameters, presumably that would be the numbers you are calculating with, from there the code returns the least precise decimal place/sig fig in order to determine the sum/difference/product/quotient's sig figs. 

## THANKS TO
• Nick Curra for the original code for `get_sig_figs()`

• Zack Hunt for helping debug assertions
